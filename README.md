# MinesweeperJS

Pure JS implementation of the classic Minesweeper game.

Big button at the top starts a new game.

This project served as my introduction to JavaScript.
I wanted to try pure JS without any NodeJS or React etc. so that I could properly learn the language.

## TODO

- Make graphics scalable (currently only 2x scale)
- Make timer more accurate (currently uses setInterval which has drifting issues)
- Fix occasional flickering / lag on slower machines when lots of tiles are revealed at once
